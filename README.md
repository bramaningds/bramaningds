# Hi, I'm [Your Name] 👋

🚀 I'm a passionate **full-stack developer** and **solo founder** who loves building real-world products that solve real-world problems. I specialize in:

- 🧱 Flutter for beautiful, performant cross-platform apps
- 🌐 Laravel & Node.js for robust, scalable backends
- 🧠 AI integrations using OpenAI & LangChain
- 🏗️ Multi-tenant SaaS applications with real paying users

## 🛠️ What I'm working on

I'm currently maintaining and growing three SaaS products:
1. **iuran.id** – A community contribution tracker
2. **keuangan.atbram.com** – A personal finance app (now on Google Play)
3. **rental system** – For managing item or property rentals

All built with **modular architecture**, **multi-tenant support**, and scalable codebases. I'm also experimenting with **AI + RAG** systems using ChromaDB, LangChain, and OpenAI.
